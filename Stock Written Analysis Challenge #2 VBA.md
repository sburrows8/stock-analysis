# Stock Analysis
Stock Analysis Challenge #2 VBA
## Overview of Project 
The purpose of this analysis was to provide Steve stock data to present to his parents to help them be more informed on the stock data within the last few years. 
In the next few paragraphs I will be comparing both the refactored and original code while detailing the advantages and disadvantages of using refactored code. I will finish by commenting on the pros and cons of using refactored code for this project. 
### Results
First, I will be comparing the original and refactored code. When running the original code for 2017 it took about 0.59 seconds to run comparing to the refactored 2017 code, the refactored populated a lot quicker at about 0.09 seconds. Next, when running the original code for 2018 it took about 0.58 seconds to run which was very close to the 2017 year of original code. When I ran the 2018 refactored code, it only took about 0.07 seconds. After comparing all of the data I just stated, I can come to the conclusion that refactored code takes less time to run than the original. 

### Summary
Furthermore, I will be noting some advantages and disadvantages of using refactored code. Some advantages I noticed while completing this challenge was that I found it very usful to already have a base of code to work with. It was easier to add and delete code I needed and did not need. I find that very usful and saves time while trying to complete a project or analysis in a timely manner. However, I  did realize that using refactored code could make for a lot more mistakes. If you are not familar with the code that was used, a mistake could easily be made that extends the time of the project. I did come accross a lot more code issues when using the refactored which was a con for my project. I was able to use google to assist me in figuring out what went wrong with my code.
